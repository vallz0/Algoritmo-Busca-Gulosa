# Greedy Search Algorithm Implementation

This project showcases an implementation of the Greedy Search Algorithm using Python. It is designed to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph based on a heuristic. The project demonstrates key concepts in graph theory, such as adjacency lists, ordered vectors, and traversal techniques.

## Features

- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using vertices (`Vertice`) and edges (`Adjacente`).
- **Heuristic-Based Search**: Implements a Greedy Search algorithm to traverse the graph.
- **Ordered Vector**: Efficiently organizes nodes based on their heuristic distance to the goal.
- **Visualization of Steps**: Displays the traversal process and decision-making during the search.

## Files

- **`Grafo.py`**: Contains the classes for graph structure (`Grafo`, `Vertice`, `Adjacente`) and methods for defining and visualizing the graph.
- **`Gulosa.py`**: Implements the Greedy Search algorithm to find a path to the target node.
- **`VetorOrdenado.py`**: Provides an ordered vector structure to manage nodes based on their heuristic distances.
